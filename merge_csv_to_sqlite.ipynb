The Division focused on industrial hygiene, radiation protection and safety. In 1946, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was created. The lab was renamed the Health and Safety Division of the AEC. In 1953 it became the Health and Safety Laboratory, or HASL. Fallout from nuclear weapons tests became a major concern and the lab's focus shifted to measurements and assessments of fallout using a network of gummed film monitoring stations and measurements of the radioactivity levels in various food products. In the 1950's and 1960's, the worldwide sampling network was expanded considerably to include soil and water samples, air filter samples at the surface and in the stratosphere, biological samples, and measurements of wet and dry fallout. In the 1970's, the lab's worldwide sampling programs were expanded to include non-nuclear pollutants. When the Atomic Energy Commission was abolished in 1975, the Health and Safety Laboratory became part of the Energy Research and Development Administration. In 1977, the Energy Research and Development Administration was absorbed by the Department of Energy, and the Health and Safety Laboratory changed its name to the Environmental Measurements Laboratory. \\nIn the 1970's, the lab performed extensive radiation transport and dosimetry studies in and around nuclear facilities, and established the Quality Assurance Program for environmental dosimeters and radioanalytical measurements. The lab also did extensive dose reconstructions for nuclear weapons tests, and studied radon in homes. The lab took immediate measurements after the Three-Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents, providing the ability to accurately and comprehensively reconstruct the environmental contamination resulting from these incidents.\\nIn 1997, the lab underwent a major change of focus when it moved from the DOE Office of Energy Research to the Office of Environmental Management. Today, EML's primary focus is to support environmental monitoring, decommissioning, decontamination, and remediation efforts. EML continues to put its worldwide monitoring network to good use by developing models of the atmospheric transport of pollutants. The lab has assisted in developing instruments in support of non-proliferation activities and conducts in-situ measurements in support of many decontamination and decommissioning activities undertaken by DOE after the end of the Cold War.

In 1995, Mound discontinued weapons component production.    The non-weapons work performed at the Mound Plant included the development and manufacture of radioisotope thermal generators; radioactive waste decontamination research; investigation of the properties of uranium, protactinium-231, and plutonium-239; and the separation of stable isotopes and noble gases.

The Parks Township facility ceased fuel fabrication activities in 1980.\\nOn April 17, 1967, NUMEC sold all of its assets to the Atlantic Richfield Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, which was given the name NUMEC II.  As a condition of that sale, the original NUMEC was required to both change its name to the “N.M.E. Liquidating Corporation” and to dissolve its corporate existence.  In 1971, the Atlantic Richfield Company sold its subsidiary NUMEC II to the Babcock & Wilcox Company (B&W).   B&W absorbed NUMEC II by the end of 1974, at which point in time NUMEC II ceased to exist.  B&W is the current owner of the Parks Township facility. NUMEC II and B&W are both “successor” corporations of NUMEC that acquired NUMEC’s statuses as an atomic weapons employer and a beryllium vendor.                                  From 2002 to 2020, the United States Army Corps of Engineers conducted remediation on a portion of the former NUMEC Parks Township site. This work occurred in an area known as the Shallow Land Disposal Area (SLDA). By the nature of the remedial work, and its location both on and adjacent to the premises of a statutory beryllium vendor, the premises of the NUMEC Parks Township site have been expanded to include the portions of the SLDA that were not within the original physical boundaries of the NUMEC Parks Township site.

The Division focused on industrial hygiene, radiation protection and safety. In 1946, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was created. The lab was renamed the Health and Safety Division of the AEC. In 1953 it became the Health and Safety Laboratory, or HASL. Fallout from nuclear weapons tests became a major concern and the lab's focus shifted to measurements and assessments of fallout using a network of gummed film monitoring stations and measurements of the radioactivity levels in various food products. In the 1950's and 1960's, the worldwide sampling network was expanded considerably to include soil and water samples, air filter samples at the surface and in the stratosphere, biological samples, and measurements of wet and dry fallout. In the 1970's, the lab's worldwide sampling programs were expanded to include non-nuclear pollutants. When the Atomic Energy Commission was abolished in 1975, the Health and Safety Laboratory became part of the Energy Research and Development Administration. In 1977, the Energy Research and Development Administration was absorbed by the Department of Energy, and the Health and Safety Laboratory changed its name to the Environmental Measurements Laboratory. \\nIn the 1970's, the lab performed extensive radiation transport and dosimetry studies in and around nuclear facilities, and established the Quality Assurance Program for environmental dosimeters and radioanalytical measurements. The lab also did extensive dose reconstructions for nuclear weapons tests, and studied radon in homes. The lab took immediate measurements after the Three-Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents, providing the ability to accurately and comprehensively reconstruct the environmental contamination resulting from these incidents.\\nIn 1997, the lab underwent a major change of focus when it moved from the DOE Office of Energy Research to the Office of Environmental Management. Today, EML's primary focus is to support environmental monitoring, decommissioning, decontamination, and remediation efforts. EML continues to put its worldwide monitoring network to good use by developing models of the atmospheric transport of pollutants. The lab has assisted in developing instruments in support of non-proliferation activities and conducts in-situ measurements in support of many decontamination and decommissioning activities undertaken by DOE after the end of the Cold War.

Government purchased 59,000 acres 12 miles west of Knoxville, Tennessee because it needed a remote location to build production plants and laboratories to produce plutonium and enriched uranium for the atomic bomb project.   This facility was known as the Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) and was referred to generally as Oak Ridge.  The entire CEW was bounded by security fences from February 1943 through March 1949.  Within the CEW were the processing plants, known as Y-12, K-25 and X-10 (now ORNL) each of which had its own security fence (a fence within a fence) and has been designated separately for purposes of the EEOIPCA.  During this time, Roane Anderson Company managed, operated and maintained residences, apartment, dormitories, guest houses, barracks, hutments, trailers, restaurants, cafeterias, buses, roads, streets, sidewalks, garbage and sewage disposal, heating plants and more for the CEW.  Roane did not, however, operate the processing plants and laboratories.  The CEW gates came down in March 1949.  This meant that people no longer needed a security clearance to enter the CEW, though clearances were still required to enter the plants and laboratories.  The fences surrounding the processing plants also remained.  It was also in 1949 that the privatization of what is today known as the City of Oak Ridge began. \\n \\nCONTRACTOR: Roane Anderson \\n   \\n\\nFacility also known as:\\n\\nOak Ridge Area  / Oak Ridge Reservation \\n\\nCoverage Dates:\\n\\n1943-1949   ', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None), ('Manufacturing Sciences Corporation ', 'checked', 'checked', '\"ᏣᎳᎫᏪᏘᏱ Tsalaguwetiyi (Cherokee, East)\",Shawandasse Tula (Shawanwaki/Shawnee),S’atsoyaha (Yuchi)', 'Tennessee', 'Oak Ridge ', 'Approximate Location', '35.97414033923917, -84.28980239925923', None, 'https://ehss.energy.gov/Search/Facility/findfacility.aspx ', 'The Manufacturing Sciences Corporation is covered by the EEOICPA. “The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program (EEOICPA) provides benefits to employees (or their survivors) of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors/subcontractors, who became ill as a result of exposure to radiation and/or other toxic substances authorized by the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA or Act).” \\n\\n----\\nManufacturing Sciences Corporation performed beryllium work for Los Alamos National Laboratory. \\n\\nFacility also known as:\\n\\n\\n\\nCoverage Dates:\\n\\n1992-1994 ', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None), ('Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant (K-25)              ', 'checked', 'checked', '\"ᏣᎳᎫᏪᏘᏱ Tsalaguwetiyi (Cherokee, East)\",Shawandasse Tula (Shawanwaki/Shawnee),S’atsoyaha (Yuchi)', 'Tennessee', 'Oak Ridge              ', 'Approximate Location', '35.97414033923917, -84.28980239925923', 'Known Story', 'https://ehss.energy.gov/Search/Facility/findfacility.aspx ', 'The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant (K-25), also known as East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), is covered by the EEOICPA. “The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program (EEOICPA) provides benefits to employees (or their survivors) of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors/subcontractors, who became ill as a result of exposure to radiation and/or other toxic substances authorized by the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA or Act).” \\n\\n----\\nThe K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was built as part of the World War II Manhattan Project to supply enriched uranium for nuclear weapons production. Construction of K-25 started in 1943.  It was the first diffusion facility for large-scale separation of uranium-235.  It became was fully operable by August 1945. Additional buildings involved in the enrichment process were operable by 1956. Along with the plants in Paducah, KY, and Portsmouth, OH, the site was used primarily for the production of highly-enriched uranium for nuclear weapons until 1964.  \\n\\nFrom 1959 to 1969, focus shifted to the production of commercial-grade, low-enriched uranium. In 1985, declining demand for enriched uranium caused the enrichment process to be placed on standby. In 1987, the process was stopped permanently.\\n\\nThe Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant was also a host for centrifuge facilities constructed as part of a program to develop and demonstrate uranium-enrichment technology. These facilities have also been shut down.   \\n\\nThroughout the course of its operations, the potential for beryllium exposure existed at this site, due to beryllium use, residual contamination, and decontamination activities. \\n\\nSince 1988, the primary DOE mission at K-25 has been remediation, though on-site DOE contractors and sub-contractors continue to provide on-site services which are covered under EEOICPA. Also during this time, DOE paid for the construction of the Toxic Substances Control Act. (TSCA) incinerator which disposed of certain regulated wastes, much of which originated at various DOE facilities. In 1997 the name of the facility was changed to the  East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) to reflect its changing nature.  However, during this period of remediation, the process of privatization of K-25 into the ETTP was ongoing. This privatization effort involved leasing portions of the premises out to private industry to conduct their own business there.

Production activities included metalworking, component fabrication and assembly, chemical recovery and purification of plutonium, and associated quality control functions.

One of the principal functions of the site was the receipt, sampling, and analysis of uranium and vanadium concentrates from the numerous ore-processing operations in the western United States. In 1951, the AEC constructed a concentrate sampling plant, assay laboratory, and two ore-testing pilot plant mills at this facility. Furthermore, the AEC established a sampling and assaying station for the receipt of uranium ores at Grand Junction. Concentrates produced by mills were delivered in steel drums to Grand Junction, where they were received, weighed, sampled, and assayed as the basis for payment to the mills under the terms of their respective contracts. \\n \\nOn September 30, 2001, the Department of Energy transferred ownership of the Grand Junction property to the Riverview Technology Corporation.

The high-enrichment portion of the diffusion cascade was shut down in 1991.  \\n\\n On July 1, 1993, the  United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC)*, a government-owned corporation formed under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, assumed control of the plant\\'s production activities. USEC, which was fully privatized in 1998, continued to produce enriched uranium for commercial use at this location until May 11, 2001 when production ceased.   During the period of USEC production, the DOE maintained responsibility for addressing the environmental legacy left by historic plant operations.  Subsequent to USEC ceasing production, the DOE contracted with USEC to maintain the plant in cold standby until the decision was made to return the plant entirely back under DOE control, which was completed by September 2011.

This was not the case and residents across the United States were harmed by radioactive fallout from testing.

The missile complex and the surrounding area were evacuated and a team of specialists was called in from Little Rock Air Force Base, the missile's main support base. About 8 1/2 hours after the initial puncture, fuel vapors within the silo ignited and exploded. The explosion fatally injured one member of the team. Twenty-one other USAR personnel were injured. The missile's re-entry vehicle, which contained a nuclear warhead, was recovered intact.

(WKBW)\\n\\nEEOICPA:\\nIn 1944, the Manhattan Engineer District (MED) obtained a portion of the Lake Ontario Ordnance Works (LOOW) from the Department of Defense (DoD) for storage of low-grade radioactive residues resulting from pitchblende ore processing at the Linde Ceramics facility. In 1948, when the DoD decommissioned the LOOW, the AEC acquired 1511 acres of the site, including the original storage areas. The AEC declared most of this property as excess in 1955 and by 1968, the General Services Administration was able to dispose of 1298 acres, with 213 acres remaining under AEC control. In 1975, additional property was transferred to the town of Lewiston, leaving the present 191-acre site. The DOE portion of the site became known as the Niagara Falls Storage Site (NFSS). The site remained under DOE control until 1997 when it was transferred to the Corps of Engineers under the FUSRAP program.\\n  \\nFollowing World War II, Linde Ceramic’s refinery was decommissioned and contaminated equipment was disposed of at the LOOW. Contaminated materials from other MED/AEC facilities were also shipped to the LOOW for disposal. Beginning in 1949, residues from operations at the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works were shipped to the LOOW for storage. During the early 1950’s, the AEC portion of the LOOW was also used for interim storage of uranium and thorium billets and rods being processed by various New York companies.  \\n\\nDuring 1953-1954, the AEC constructed a boron isotope separation plant at the LOOW, which began operations in 1954. The operating contractor for this plant was the Hooker Electrochemical Company, which referred to it as Plant 31 (P31). In 1958, the facility was placed on stand-by and a maintenance contractor, Page Airways, was employed for routine surveillance. The operation was restarted in 1964, with the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Company (NUMEC) as the operating contractor until April 17, 1967, when NUMEC sold all of its assets to the Atlantic Richfield Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, which was given the name NUMEC II.  NUMEC II was the operating contractor until 1971, when the boron facility was again placed on stand-by with the National Lead Company of Ohio (NLO) as the caretaker. In 1981, Bechtel National took over the caretaker contract and began plans for remedial work at the site.
